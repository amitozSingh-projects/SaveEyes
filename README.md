This project was started after myeyesight deterioted. I wanted to protect my eyes hence, I thought of implementing this idea. 

There are still errors in this but the exe file works alright. I aim to improve the GUI and functionalities as I learn about python GUI more.

The application would remind you of looking away for a certain duration if you have been on you screen for a while. It is simple doctor's advice implemented via code.

Almost everyone can use this.

Thank You.
